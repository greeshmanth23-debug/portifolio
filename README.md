# Portifolio
This repository contains the source code for my **personal portfolio website**, developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The website highlights my background as an aspiring software and frontend developer, my projects (including SmartRetail AI), technical skills, and experience.

Key features include:

* Responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices
* Clean and modern UI design
* Project showcase with live demo links
* Structured sections for About, Skills, Projects, and Experience

The goal of this project is to present my profile professionally while following best practices in frontend development and user-focused design.
